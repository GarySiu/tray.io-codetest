## tray.io Code Test
This is a very minimal solution to the test.
## Setup
* `git clone` the repo
* `npm install` (optional) to install the single depedency (mocha for testing)
* `npm test` to run tests
* `node index.js` to run the app from the commandline.
## Possible future enhancements
* cross platform reuse
* improved testing
* add linting, editorcfg etc. for more consistent code
* inline documentation using JSDoc or similar
